# WSC_NotebooksPaper

This repository contains the python notebooks and in vitro and in vivo data used in the workflow to produce the figures & results in our paper “Cell-autonomous timing drives the vertebrate segmentation clock’s wave pattern” (Rohde et al. 2023). Please use the subject titles of the notebook to find data & code & results of interest. Note, the data folder is not organized according to Rohde et la. 2023 figure number. Enjoy!

To run the notebooks, please install the following conda enviroment:

```shell
conda env create -f wsc.yml
